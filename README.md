ðŸ§¼ Clean file generation flow?

Letâ€™s say your RSS parser generates the file on request. You can:

    Generate a tempfile

    Write the parsed feed contents

    Use send_file or send_from_directory to let users download the file.

    Optionally delete it after (unless you like digital hoarding)

Bonus move? Timestamp the filename with datetime.now().strftime(...) so users get:

feed_export_2025-05-21.txt
